### Hi there I am Georgia GkegkaðŸ‘‹
I am a Computing Student. I practice myself on HTML and JAVA languages. I am currenlty working on creating websites that will meet the needs of our customers. Website design is one of my interests which I would like to pursue professionally in the future, having expanded even more my knowledge in this field.

Drawing is one of my favourite hobby. I practice myself to this and through the drawing I express my feelings.
